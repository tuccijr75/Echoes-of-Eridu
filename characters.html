  <section class="earth-text" aria-label="Characters">
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Adamu</span> — The First People. Survivors who remember when law was a promise between neighbors, not a weapon. They seek to free worlds from imperial ledgers, one oath at a time. Their arc wrestles with inheritance vs. reinvention: do they restore what was, or build something untested but kinder?</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Apsari</span> — Marsh-court singers raised on canal rites and tide-law. They treat water as witness and contract. Their story is about mending the broken “water chain” across cities and exposing the empires that privatized the rain.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Siltae</span> — Delta roamers whose caravans write maps with festivals instead of borders. They barter in favors, rumors, and Names. Their journey tests whether a culture built on motion can anchor to defend a place without becoming what they flee.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Kudran</span> — Keepers of boundary-stones and oath-markers. They believe truth is something you can stand on. When borders are weaponized, they pivot from measuring land to measuring justice—re-inscribing rights the empires erased.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Lapisar</span> — Ledger scholars and memory curators who treat archives as living beings. They rescue lost filings, outlawed songs, and forbidden Names. Their drama pits preservation against liberation: when history harms, what do you erase, and what do you redeem?</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Shardim</span> — Storm-plateau tacticians who harness lightning’s chaos to keep roads open. They are excellent at breaking siege cycles. Their arc is about learning mercy without losing their edge as the war grinds on.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Halor</span> — Gate-keepers of the Halo Ways who balance traffic, tribute, and cease-fires. They can halt a war by closing a door. Their conflict: when neutrality starts to favor tyrants, is it still neutral?</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Specari</span> — Mirror-court jurists from the bright cities who “compile” destinies by reflecting many small choices. They want clean systems that don’t crush the poor. Their lesson: perfect designs fail if they ignore messy hearts.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Prismal</span> — Duelists of interpretation who split a single edict into many fair paths. They travel between factions to translate law into mercy. Their test is resisting the seduction of power once everyone starts asking them to decide everything.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Rillith</span> — Low-gravity settlers along ancient rilles and basalt crowns. They build waystations and quiet sanctuaries where fighters lay down arms. Their arc: keep the peace corridors open while empires try to co-opt them.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Bitum</span> — Kiln guilds and firewrights who turn waste and tar into fuel, roads, and refuge. They were once pressed into imperial industry; now they smuggle hope under cover of “repairs.” Their struggle is to light the world without burning out their own.</p>
    <p class="race"><span class="race-name">Oathen</span> — Vow-smiths who forge compacts between rivals and bind them to consequence. They are trusted when promises need teeth. Their dilemma: what do you do when the greater good requires breaking the perfect oath you made?</p>
