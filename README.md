# Echoes of Eridu — Static Site
Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1) Create repo → upload this folder's contents to the repo root.
2) Settings → Pages → Source = main branch / (root).
3) Put models at `models/<race>/model.glb` (e.g., `models/adamu/model.glb`).

Open `/races/adamu.html` to test. If the model doesn't appear, the viewer will overlay a banner listing every URL it tried.
