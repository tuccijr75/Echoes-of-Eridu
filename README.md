NO-CDN BUILD (local libs)
--------------------------------
1) Upload this entire folder to your GitHub repo.
2) Put your GLB at models/<race>/model.glb (e.g., models/adamu/model.glb).
3) Populate /libs/ with three.js ESM files listed in libs/README.txt (local copies â€” no external CDNs).
4) Open /races/adamu.html. The viewer shows a status badge with success/errors.
